Open Anniversary

In 2021, the open source movement will be celebrating several important milestones, including the 20th Anniversary of Wikipedia and Creative Commons, as well as the 30th Anniversary of Linux and the World Wide Web.

Celebrating Anniversaries is much more than just throwing a party. It is also an opportunity to look back in history, to reevaluate the mission and values, and to build a new future for an organization or community.

With that in mind, Open Anniversary aims to provide an innovative and inclusive platform for the community to celebrate, remember, and reimagine the open source movement.
