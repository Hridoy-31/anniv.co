            <p>The 2021 Open Anniversary celebrations will revolve around 12 themes, one for each month of the year. A major milestone was selected for each theme. For example: the first month, January, will be dedicated to celebrating "Free Culture," when both Wikipedia and Creative Commons share their 20th Anniversary. The themes are presented below:</p>

                  <p>On January 15, 2001, Wikipedia was established. Creative Commons was coincidentally established on the same date. Wikipedia was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, while Creative Commons was founded by Lawrence Lessig, Hal Abelson, and Eric Eldred.

                  <p>The "open source" label was created by Christine Peterson at a strategy session held on February 3rd, 1998 in Palo Alto, California. That same month, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) was founded by Bruce Perens and Eric Raymond as a general educational and advocacy organization. The group adopted the Open Source Definition for open-source software, based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines.</p>

Red Had celebrates its anniversary in March--Bob Young founded ACC Corporation in March 1983 and the company was later renamed to Red Hat Software when merged with Marc Ewing's business.</p>

            <p>For each of the 12 Anniversary themes, there will be a variety of activities, including blog posts, online discussions, webinars, interviews, contests, and community meetups (in compliance with local public health guidelines).</p><p>The prime attraction for each theme will be a collection of interactive timelines: a main timeline and related timelines from key organizations and individuals. For example, in January there will be the "Free Culture" timeline, as well as the "Creative Commons" and "Wikipedia" timelines, along with the "Lawrence Lessig" and "Jimmy Wales" timelines.</p><p>Members of the community will be able to upvote milestones from the main timeline to highlight which ones they believe were most important. They will also be able to create and share their own personal timelines featured side-by-side with the main timeline.</p><p>While each month will be focused on a theme, community members will be able to participate in activities and share timelines from each theme throughout the whole year.</p><p>All activities should adopt a code of conduct that contributes to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. The Open Anniversary platform itself will be adopting the Contributor Covenant, version 2.0 code of conduct.</p>
